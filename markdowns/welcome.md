# Initial demo

When you click the "Run" button, the SPARQL query is executed against a predefined RDF dataset, and the result is displayed through a custom script. Coming soon, an actual tutorial.

@[Who knows who?]({"stubs": ["query.sparql", "data.rdf"], "command": "python3 run_query.py query.sparql data.rdf xml"})

In this case, the dataset can be modified locally to directly test the impact of the data structure on the query result.

This tutorial is based on the lectures taught by Nathalie Hernandez and Camille Pradel.
